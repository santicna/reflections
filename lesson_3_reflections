When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

Anytime I need to work with any other person, or am changing computers (I.E. home and work).
A remote repository makes it much easier to fetch the data from one place.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Because there might be unwanted changes made in the remote that you don't want in your local.
By always pulling manually you also make sure of what you're adding to the local from Github.
